## Project Description

This project is designed to demonstrate the process of uploading PDF files to a MongoDB database using a Node.js application. Users can upload PDF files via a provided API, and the files are stored in the database along with their metadata.

## Features

- File upload to MongoDB
- Retrieval of uploaded files
- Basic error handling

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chiragmakkar13/FileUpload.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure your MongoDB connection:
   
   - Open `app.js` and update the MongoDB connection string (`'mongodb://localhost:27017/fileUpload'`) with your own MongoDB connection string.

5. Start the Node.js server:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

## Usage

To upload a PDF file to MongoDB using this application:

Via Web Browser:
1.Start your Node.js server by running node app.js.
